## 🔄 Reorder Point Algorithms

### Dynamic Reorder Point Calculation

**Base Formula**:
```
Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage × Lead Time) + Safety Stock
```

**Advanced Formula with Variability**:
```
Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage × Average Lead Time) + 
                (Z-Score × √((Average Lead Time × Usage Variance) + 
                (Average Daily Usage² × Lead Time Variance)))
```

**Service Level Targets**:
- **A-Items**: 99% service level (Z-Score = 2.33)
- **B-Items**: 95% service level (Z-Score = 1.65)
- **C-Items**: 90% service level (Z-Score = 1.28)
